Programming Assignment 2

Due: Sunday Aug 15, 11:59pm

Problem
Write a program that asks the user to enter the month (represented as a number in the range 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number of days in that month. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:

Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
Example: if the user enters 2 for the month and 2008 for the year, the program should say that month has 29 days.

Instructions
Create a new Python file and place intro comments using the template below.
Use comments to write the algorithm your program will follow.
Draw a flowchart and label the possible control paths. You may draw it using pen and paper and then submit a picture.
Create an Excel file with at least one test case for each control path. Use one row per test case with one column for the case's label matching the flowchart, one column for each input, and one column for each corresponding output.
Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
Test your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
